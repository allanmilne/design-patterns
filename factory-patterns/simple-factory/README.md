# How CHANGE impacts our use of `new`


Every time we instantiate a new object using the `new` operator we are programming to an implementation and not an
interface.

üí° When you see `new`, think ‚ÄúCONCRETE‚Äù

</aside>

Tying our code to a concrete class can make it more fragile and less flexible.


By coding to an interface we can insulate ourselves from many of the changes that might happen to a system throughout
its lifespan.
For example, if our code is written to an interface, then it will work with any new classes implementing that interface
through polymorphism.
However, when we have a system that makes use of lots of *concrete* classes, over time, our code may have to be changed
as new concrete classes are introduced. This effectively breaks
the [Open-closed Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle) making our design "*open* for
modification" meaning that every time we want to extend our code with new concrete types, we'd have to reopen it and
make changes to **many** parts of our codebase.

## The Simple Factory

The Simple Factory isn't actually a design pattern but more of a programming idiom and is certainly worth mentioning
here. A
[Simple Factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_%28object-oriented_programming%29) is an object used to create
other objects.

## PizzaStore Example

Here we are using a simple factory to handle the details of object creation. If new Pizza's need to be added or
non-selling Pizza's removed then refactoring only has to happen in one place; the `SimplePizzaFactory` class.
